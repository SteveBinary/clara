# Export

CLARA offers two different ways for exporting the aggregated Architecture:

- [GraphViz](./svg/index.md) to create a quick SVG export of the architecture.
- [Gropius](./gropius/index.md) to create a dynamic Gropius representation of the architecture, exported and added to the configured Gropius project. For more details on Gropius visit the [GitHub Page](https://github.com/ccims).
