# OpenTelemetry

CLARA can utilize OpenTelemetry traces as data source for finding components and to some extent component types, 
as well as communications between components. For that feature to work correctly, it is crucial to have instrumented applications
and an OpenTelemetry Collector running in the cluster as described below.
